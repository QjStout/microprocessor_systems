# microprocessor_systems

All work was done in collaboration with my fellow student, David Duke.</br>

All code is for an Atmel Atmega168 microprocessor.</br>
File 01 contains code and documentation for a 7-segment display and a delay using the timer/counter register.</br>
File 02 contains code and documentation for a 12-key keypad, used to navigate between a selection of timed LED light functions.</br>
